            The TouchBar is a rare gimmick for Apple. After 4 years, I think
            it's fair consider it a failure, but still the question remains.
            Why? The more I thought about this question the more I began to see
            why Apple might have 1) chosen the keyboard as a locus of innovation
            in the 2016 MacBook Pro, and 2) decided the TouchBar was chosen as a
            solution.

            <Heading>What problem was Apple trying to solve?</Heading>
            <p>
              The TouchBar isn't the first time Apple decided to rethink the
              function row. Apple's keyboards have been evolving for decades. In
              fact, their early keyboards didn't include a function row at all.

              IBM popularized function keys. Apple eventually added them too.

                Notice how the top right keys control volume? Apple didn't
                introduce the media keys all at once. Image from{" "}

            <p>
              Apple later decided the function row should have default behaviors
              rather than being general-purpose. Below, is the modern iteration:
            </p>
            <Img src="/posts/touchbar/touchbar-3.jpeg" />
            <p>
              Why would Apple decide to replace these keys with a TouchBar?
              Maybe it's because some of the keys aren't as useful as we think.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like most pro users, I use the ESC key a lot. I use the media keys
              often. I also adjust brightness a lot more than I'd like to admit.
              But there are also keys I never use (in red, below).
            </p>
            <Img src="/posts/touchbar/touchbar-4.jpeg" />
            <p>
              Of the 14 keys, 4 are useless to me. If your usage looks similar
              to mine, you're likely among the most frustrated by Apple's new
              keyboard.
            </p>
            <p>
              But what if I'm not listening to music? That's when I start to see
              the rationale behind Apple's thinking.
            </p>
            <Img src="/posts/touchbar/touchbar-5.jpeg" />
            <p>
              The result is that 10 out of 14 keys go unused. And because I'm a
              weirdo for adjusting my display brightness multiple times a day, I
              think the average person just uses the ESC key.

            <Heading>Why a TouchBar?</Heading>
            <p>
              Shouldn't Apple, in pursuit of simplicity, keep only the ESC and
              power buttons? For the average user sure, but for power users the
              keys represent an opportunity for innovation.

                  width: 15em;
                `}
              />
              But why replace keys with a touchscreen? The TouchBar isn't the
              first time Apple eschewed physical keys for touch inputs. When the
              iPhone was released, people thought they'd miss the physical
              keyboard (which the Blackberry had), but were delighted to be
              wrong. If a touch-based keyboard was good enough as a primary
              input mechanism on a phone, it's certainly a reasonable
              replacement for the infrequently used function row.

            Depending on who you are, the new design is probably worse for you
            in one way or another. If Apple can make up for it by making the
            rest of the TouchBar useful enough, then in theory it could win
            people back.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you listen to a lot of music then you're going to be very annoyed
            by the TouchBar. If that's you, I'd suggest you do what I did and go
            into the Keyboard settings and make the Touch Bar show the "Expanded
            Control Strip" as you can see below.
          </p>
          <Img src="/posts/touchbar/touchbar-8.jpeg" />
          <p>
            Another conclusion I can draw from my findings is that the value of
            the function keys depends on the context. In fact, that's why IBM
            added them. In this sense, Apple's TouchBar is a reformulation of
            the classic function row.
          </p>

          <p>
            I think it's safe to conclude that Apple had good reasons to embark
            on reinventing the function row. They identified something I didn't
            know was a problem. This is classic Apple. I think the problem is
            about how they decided to tackle the problem. When the iPhone was
            released, people thought they'd miss the physical keyboard (that the
            Blackberry had), but were delighted to be wrong. In this case, many
            people aren't excited about the new design. In 2020 I'm still not in
            love with it.

          <p>Some alternatives I can think of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Remove the function row entirely. When you press the fn key, allow
              an app to display a UI on
            </li>
            <li>Replace the caps lock key with the esc key</li>
          </ul>
        </VStack>
      </div>
