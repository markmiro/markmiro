title: How I Interview Candidates
---

After interviewing enough times, it's easy to forget that the candidate is meeting you for the first time and doesn't know what to expect. If I'm in the middle of coding just before an interview, it can be hard to snap into the interview mindset. I found that having a checklist makes the process buttery smooth. Every candidate gets the same treatment and it's easier to compare candidates fairly.

I developed a little script for myself while I was interviewing. It's based on the structure that Thumbtack used when I was there, but this script isn't specific to the company.

## Before the Interview

- Open the right tabs on my computer
  - Calendar
  - Codepair (app that lets me see what they're coding)
  - Notes app
  - Scoring rubric (problem solving, language familiarity, coding practices, technical communication)
  - Interview questions
- Double-check the room for interview
- Double-check my warmup question
- Double-check the name of the person I'm interviewing (I like to have this last so it's fresh on my mind)

## Intro

> Hi **INTERVIEWEE**, I'm **MY NAME** from **COMPANY** and I'll be interviewing you today for a position at **COMPANY**.

> **WHEN PHONE**: Thanks for taking time to interview with us. Is now still a good time?

It may seem odd to ask this, but if a candidate isn't ready, it's best to know as early as possible. Then you can decide where to go from there and you don't have to waste as much time.

> **IN PERSON**: Would you like some water or anything before we get started?

This gives the person an opportunity to freshen up if they want to. Back to back interviews can be brutal and it's easy to forget that they may not have had an opportunity to take a break.

> Before we get started, I'll explain a little bit about me and my role at **COMPANY**.

It's really tempting to jump into the interview, but letting the person know who's interviewing them helps the set expecations for what will be asked and what they themselves might want to ask me at the end of the interview.

> Just to give you an overview of the next hour I'll ask a non-technical question to get the ball rolling and then we'll spend the rest of the time on coding. At the end we'll try to leave time for any questions you might have for me.

Setting expections is important! If someone finishes quickly, they know they'll have time to ask questions at the end.

> Let's start with a warmup question: **WARMUP QUESTION** (EX: Tell me about a recent project you liked working on).

A company I worked at liked to have a warmup that doesn't take much time just to get the candidate to open up and it wasn't judged in the interview.

> Alright, let's jump into the technical question.

When showing code pair:

> - You should see a UI that looks like CodePen or JSFiddle if you're familiar with one of those.
> - On the bottom right there's a render button.

> Today I'll have you build **TECHNICAL CODING QUESTION**.
>
> - You can look stuff up as needed (since this isn't a memory test).
> - Feel free to use the devtools and any debugging method that you feel comfortable with.
> - You can code the solution using any any techniques that you're comfortable with.

During the coding session I like to let the person solve the problem, but if they're really stuck, I give them a hint. If they're still stuck, I help them solve the thing their stuck on.

## Closing

Two options for the transition

> 1. I can see where you're going, and we're almost out of time. I wanted to give you the opportunity to ask any questions you have.
> 2. **IF THEY REALLY WON'T STOP**: You've had the opportunity to impress me, and now it's my turn to impress you with what's great about **COMPANY**. What questions do you have about working here?"

Sometimes people will ask about pros and cons of working at the company. It's good to have a few answers in mind.

Some candidates ask about cons of working at the company. I think the best answer to this question is something that is a positive for the people who work at the company, but could be a negative for the wrong candidates. Example: if the company is good for curious people because you adopt emerging technologies and trends, then I'd mention that it's not great for people who aren't always staying sharp. If the company likes established technologies, I'd say it's not great for people who are always on the bleeding edge and that we wait for technologies to mature since we value stability and put great care into the technologies we choose. Every company makes different tradeoffs depending on its priorities, so I try to emphasize the benefits of those tradeoffs.

My goal is for the interviewee to come away feeling positive about the company regardless of whether they did well or not.
