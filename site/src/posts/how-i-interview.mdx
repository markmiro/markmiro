title: How I Interview
---

After doing interviewing enough times, it's easy to forget that the candidate is meeting you for the first time and doesn't know what to expect. If I'm in the middle of coding just before an interview, it can be hard to snap into the interview mindset. I found that having a checklist makes the process buttery smooth. Every candidate gets the same treatment and it's easier to compare candidates fairly.

I developed a little script for myself while I was at Thumbtack. It's based on the structure that Thumbtack used when I was there, but this script isn't specific to any company. I think it can work anywhere.

## Before the Interview

- Open the right tabs on my computer
  - Calendar
  - Codepair
  - Notes app for interview
  - Scoring rubric (problem solving, language familiarity, coding practices, technical communication)
  - Interview questions
- Double-check the room for interview
- Double-check my warmup question
- Double-check the name of the person I'm interviewing (I like to have this last so it's fresh on my mind)

## Intro

Hi [First name], I'm [Foobar] from [Company] and I'll be interviewing you today for a position at [Company]
[WHEN PHONE] Thanks for taking time to interview with us. Is now still a good time?
Before we get started, I'll explain a little bit about me and my role at [Company]
Just to give you an overview of the next hour I'll ask a non-technical question to get the ball rolling and then we'll spend the rest of the time on coding. At the end we'll try to leave time for any questions you might have for me.

For the non-technical, ...
[Warmup question. EX: Tell me about a recent project you liked working on]

Alright, let's jump into the technical question

- When showing code pair

  - You should see a UI that looks like CodePen or JSFiddle if you're familiar with one of those
  - On the bottom right there's a render button

- Today, I'll have you build... explain question

  - You can look stuff up as needed (since this isn't a memory test).
  - Feel free to use the devtools and any debugging method that you feel comfortable with
  - You can code the solution using any any techniques that you're comfortable with

[During the coding session I like to let the person solve the problem, but if they're really stuck, I give them a hint. If they're still stuck, I help them solve the thing their stuck on.]

## Closing

Two options for the transition

- "I can see where you're going, and we're almost out of time. I wanted to give you the opportunity to ask any questions you have."
- If they really won't stop: "You've already had the opportunity to impress me, and now it's my turn to impress you with how great a place Thumbtack is to work. What questions do you have about working here?"

Why work at [Company]. I like to have a list of things I like.

Cons working at [Company] if they ask. I think the best answer to this question is something that is a positive for the people who work at the company, but could be a negative for the wrong candidates. Example: if the company is good for curious people because you adopt emerging technologies and trends, then I'd mention that it's not great for people who aren't always staying sharp. If the company likes established technologies, I'd say it's not great for people who are always on the bleeding edge and that we wait for technologies to mature since we value stability and put great care into the technologies we choose. Does this sound a little manipulative? I can see how it might seem that way. Every company makes different tradeoffs depending on its priorities.

My goal is for the interviewee to come away feeling positive about the company regardless of whether they did well or not.
