4 years since the advent of the Apple TouchBar, it's still a gimmick. But why would Apple make it? The more I thought about this question the more I began to see why Apple...

1. Chose the keyboard as a locus of innovation in the 2016 MacBook Pro.
2. Decided the TouchBar was a good solution.

## What problem was Apple trying to solve?

The TouchBar isn't the first time Apple decided to rethink the function row. Apple's
keyboards have been evolving for decades. In fact, their early keyboards didn't
include a function row at all.

IBM popularized function keys. Apple eventually added them too.

    Notice how the top right keys control volume? Apple didn't introduce the
    media keys all at once. Image from{" "}

Apple later decided the function row should have default behaviors rather
than being general-purpose. Below, is the modern iteration:

Why would Apple decide to replace these keys with a TouchBar? Maybe it's
because some of the keys aren't as useful as we think.

Like most pro users, I use the ESC key a lot. I use the media keys often. I
also adjust brightness a lot more than I'd like to admit. But there are also
keys I never use (in red, below).

Of the 14 keys, 4 are useless to me. If your usage looks similar to mine,
you're likely among the most frustrated by Apple's new keyboard.

But what if I'm not listening to music? That's when I start to see the
rationale behind Apple's thinking.

The result is that 10 out of 14 keys go unused. And because I'm a weirdo for
adjusting my display brightness multiple times a day, I think the average
person just uses the ESC key.

## Why a TouchBar?

Shouldn't Apple, in pursuit of simplicity, keep only the ESC and power
buttons? For the average user sure, but for power users the keys represent
an opportunity for innovation.

But why replace keys with a touchscreen? The TouchBar isn't the first time Apple
eschewed physical keys for touch inputs. When the iPhone was released, people thought
they'd miss the physical keyboard (which the Blackberry had), but were delighted
to be wrong. If a touch-based keyboard was good enough as a primary input mechanism
on a phone, it's certainly a reasonable replacement for the infrequently used function
row.

## Other solutions

Depending on who you are, the new design is probably worse for you in one way
or another. If Apple can make up for it by making the rest of the TouchBar
useful enough, then in theory it could win people back.

If you listen to a lot of music then you're going to be very annoyed by the
TouchBar. If that's you, I'd suggest you do what I did and go into the
Keyboard settings and make the Touch Bar show the "Expanded Control Strip" as
you can see below.

Another conclusion I can draw from my findings is that the value of the
function keys depends on the context. In fact, that's why IBM added them. In
this sense, Apple's TouchBar is a reformulation of the classic function row.

I think it's safe to conclude that Apple had good reasons to embark on
reinventing the function row. They identified something I didn't recognize as a
problem. This is classic Apple. I think the problem is about how they decided
to tackle the problem. When the iPhone was released, people thought they'd
miss the physical keyboard (that the Blackberry had), but were delighted to be
wrong. In this case, many people aren't excited about the new design. In 2020
I'm still not in love with it.

## Solutions

### 1. Bring back the old function keys

They worked pretty well.

### 2. Remove the function row entirely

This is going to be a little complicated, so bear with me. The iPad Pro keyboard already does away with the funciton row. When you press the fn key, allow an app to display a UI on the screen similar to what happens when you press `CMD + TAB`. Put caps lock in this menu. Replace the `CAPS LOCK` key with `ESC`. The TouchId / power button can be put somewhere else on the laptop body.
